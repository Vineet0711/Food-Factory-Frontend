            <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
            <p>
There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Food Factory. Not our pizzas. Not our people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we’re at it. <b>We’re the pizza company that lives life unboxed.</b></p>

            <h3>WHAT WE’RE ABOUT</h3>
            <p>At Food Factory, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy. Pizza Hut was built on the belief that pizza night should be special, and we carry that belief into everything we do. With more than 55 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to best serve our customers through tried and true service principles: <b>We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.</b></p>

            <h3>WHERE WE COME FROM</h3>
            <p>In 1958, two friends borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Food Factory, because their sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family. And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.</p>
